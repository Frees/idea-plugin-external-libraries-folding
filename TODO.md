# Dependency Folding Plugin - Development Tasks

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Setup and Research
- [x] Create initial plugin project structure
- [x] Configure build.gradle.kts for IntelliJ plugin development
- [x] Research IntelliJ Platform API for Project View customization
- [x] Study the structure of External Libraries in Project View
- [x] Identify extension points needed for modifying Project View

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [x] Create a custom ProjectViewNodeDecorator implementation
- [x] Implement a custom ProjectTreeStructureProvider to modify the External Libraries node
- [x] Develop logic to identify and group dependencies by source (Maven, Gradle, etc.)
- [x] Implement package-based grouping for dependencies
- [ ] Create custom icons for different types of dependency groups (placeholder implementation)

### Phase 3: UI and User Experience
- [x] Design and implement custom tree nodes for grouped dependencies
- [x] Ensure proper expansion/collapse behavior for tree nodes
- [x] Implement proper sorting of dependencies within groups
- [x] Add tooltips with additional information for dependency nodes
- [x] Ensure compatibility with different IDE themes

### Phase 4: Documentation and Release
- [x] Update plugin.xml with proper descriptions and metadata
- [x] Complete user documentation
- [ ] Create screenshots for plugin marketplace (to be done after testing)
- [x] Prepare release notes (in build.gradle.kts)
- [ ] Submit to JetBrains Plugin Repository (to be done after testing)

## Technical Notes

### Key Classes Implemented
- [x] `DependencyFoldingProjectViewNodeDecorator`: For customizing node appearance
- [x] `DependencyFoldingTreeStructureProvider`: For modifying the tree structure
- [x] `DependencyGroupNode`: Custom node type for grouped dependencies
- [x] `DependencySourceGroup`: Logic for identifying and grouping by source
- [x] `DependencyPackageGroup`: Logic for package-based grouping

### Extension Points Used
- [x] `com.intellij.treeStructureProvider`: For modifying Project View tree structure
- [x] `com.intellij.projectViewNodeDecorator`: For customizing node appearance

### Future Performance Improvements
- [ ] Implement caching for dependency analysis
- [ ] Use lazy loading for tree nodes
- [ ] Consider background processing for large dependency sets
